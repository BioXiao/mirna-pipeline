ECORC miRNA Pipeline
-------
(PDF manual in documentation folder) 

***WARNING***
The scripts in this pipeline utilize wildcards for filenames. ALWAYS read the script to see if it is necessary to change them so that your files are compatible as well. 

The original pipeline was designed and created by Mahdi Rahman, a graduate computer science student at the University of Manitoba, and his supervisor, Dr. Mike Domaratzki. They can be reached at rahman.safiurbd@gmail.com
and mdomarat@cs.umanitoba.ca, respectively. The code that you are about to be using today is directly based on the original pipeline, but has been heavily modified, refactored, and documented by Douglas Huang, a bioinformatician at Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, so if there are any inquiries or issues regarding the code or procedure, please direct them to him, at dhdouglas.huang@gmail.com. 

A manual can be found within the documentation folder. Feel free to modify the LaTeX document should you have anything to add.
